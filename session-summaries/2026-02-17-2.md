# Session Summary — February 17, 2026 (Session 2)

## Overview
> Brief continuation session that verified the recommendation fix from the previous session. The fix resolved conflicting ML recommendation numbers where the ideal focus block length (~33 min) exceeded the procrastination onset time (~29 min). After applying `min(focus_block_limit, procrastination_onset)` as the break point, the app was restarted and confirmed working — no crashes, dashboard refreshed successfully with 34 sessions.

## Goals & Intentions
- Restart the app to verify the recommendation consistency fix from the previous session

## Key Decisions Made
- None new — continuing from previous session's fix

## Work Completed
- [x] Restarted BurnoutTracker app to test the recommendation fix
- [x] Confirmed app launches without crashes (no segfault)
- [x] Confirmed dashboard refreshes successfully with 34 sessions
- [x] ML predictor trains all 6 models on startup as expected

## Technical Notes
- App startup is clean — all 6 ML models train successfully (time_to_burnout, time_to_procrastination, time_to_break, net_focused_time, time_to_first_interruption, focus_block_length)
- The `AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps` deprecation warning persists but is harmless (PySide6 handles high DPI automatically now)
- The recommendation fix from the previous session (using `min(focus_block_limit, procrastination_onset)` as break point) is now live

## Open Questions / Blockers
- None

## Next Steps
- Visually verify the recommendation panel shows consistent numbers on the dashboard
- Consider caching ML model training to avoid retraining on every dashboard refresh
- Consider adding trend arrows to recommendation insights
